# Music Player Developer Test
A Coding Test for .NET Developers as part of the Chambers and Partners application process

Create a mockup of a music player application.
It should have all the selection features described below but no real music playing capabilities.
It should consist of front end application in WPF and back end in WebAPI or WCF.
The backend should have mocked list of songs and playlists.
Each song should have name, artist, genre and duration.
The frontend should consist of two panels, Songs and playlists.
The Songs panel should allow user to select preferred artist and genre and click the load button to load preferred songs.
If the user doesn’t select anything it means that songs shouldn’t be filtered by this attribute.
The list of songs should contain name of the song, name of the artist duration, and a button to add a song to the current playlist.
If no playlist is selected, a new one should be created.
The playlists panel should allow to select a playlist.
After the playlist is selected, list of its songs should be displayed.
The list should look similar to the one in the songs panel the button should remove the song from the playlist.
There should be also buttons to save and delete selected playlist.
